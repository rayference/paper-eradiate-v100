    "This example notebook demonstrates a fairly complex usage scenario of Eradiate. It leverages a scene generator developed as part of the [3DREAMS project](https://www.grasp-earth.com/portfolio/3dreams/) to generate a synthetic scene modelled after an area located close to the city of Dakar, in Senegal. Interested readers can refer to the 3DREAMS project documentation and published material for context and details.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scene uses a triangulated DEM mesh sourced from the Copernicus GLO-30 DEM dataset, and land cover data from the ESA WorldCover dataset, both resampled at 100 m resolution to keep memory requirements reasonable. The scene is split into three regions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The target region has the highest level of detail and features 100 m-resolution land cover information, and a 30 m-resolution DEM. In this area (a 100 km × 100 km square around the centre of the scene), instances of 3D objects are created on the 100 m × 100 m lattice defined by the DEM and land cover data. The target region is where the simulated instrument is meant to be pointed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The buffer region has a lower level of detail, with the DEM resampled at 100 m-resolution, and features no instances of 3D objects. Its role is to provide realistic diffuse radiation / adjacency to measurements made in the target region.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The background region has a uniform diffuse reflectance and should not be radiatively visible in the target region.\n",
    "\n",
    "When loaded with all possible details (resolved DEM and instances), the scene can be quite large in memory. To allow all users to run this notebook, the default settings remove most detail from the scene. Comments explain how to add more objects and complexity to this lightweight setup.\n",
