    "A hypothetical measurement of the BRF would require a directional illumination and sensor. This, in practice, can only be achieved (approximately) in a laboratory, illuminating a target with a collimated beam and recording the reflected radiance with a radiometer with a very narrow field of view.\n",

    "When performing field measurements, an instrument is pointed at a target illuminated by the sky. Consequently, the only measurement that is available (again, approximately) factors in the illumination by the sky, which is generally far from directional. What we can compute in such conditions is the hemispherical-directional reflectance factor (HDRF).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nicodemus et al. (1977) defines it as the integral of the BRDF on the incoming direction space. In practice, it can also be obtained by dividing a reflected radiance record by the total incident flux (this operation is identical to the one made to compute the BRF from our simulation results):\n",

    "Eradiate can be used to compute the HDRF. Computing the reflected radiance $L_\\mathrm{r}$ is straightforward; however, the scene setup prevents us from sampling easily the incident flux term $E_\\mathrm{i}$. The reason is that to sample an emitter, it has to be visible in the field of view of the sensor — in other words, one needs to be able to \"hit\" it when casting a ray from the sensor; however, the illumination is perfectly directional, which means that it has an angular aperture exactly equal to 0, and that it is in practice never visible to a sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can however sample the emitter indirectly thanks to next event estimation (a.k.a. local estimate), which will sample the directional emitter at every scattering event. For that purpose, we add to the scene a flat, horizontal panel (*e.g.* a disk) with a diffuse reflectance equal to 1. All the incident radiation at the sensor is reflected without energy loss: if we sample it over the entire hemisphere, we indirectly sample the total incident flux at the surface (both the direct and diffuse components). The relationship between the incident flux and the reflected radiance is:\n",

    "One more detail: if the panel is large, it will significantly perturb the diffuse radiation field, effectively biasing the incident radiative flux measurement. To reduce the perturbation to a negligible amount, we set the size of the panel to a very small value (*e.g.* 10 cm)."
